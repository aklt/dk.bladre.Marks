# db.bladre.Marks -- Add marks to locations in Renoise

The Marks tool makes it possible to use letters as markers of different positions
in the renoise GUI. Positions remembered include:

* Pattern, track, line and note column
* Selected instrument
* Selected
* Middle panel view
* Active upper and lower panel

Marks are saved in the "________Marks________" instrument and will be saved
together with the song so they are restored when the song is reopened at a
later time.

To use it map "Global:Tools:Marks" to a convenient shortcut to open the dialog.

Press the "add" of "jump" buttons to add/jump to a mark. Typing lowercase
letters will jump to the mark and uppercase letters will save a mark.

TODO:

Make it possible to designate one of the marks as a quick mark so that it
may be jumped to without having to open the dialog.
